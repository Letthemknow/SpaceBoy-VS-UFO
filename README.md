## Requirements
* The sprite should consist of at least 5 different primitive shapes (ie: ovals, rectangles, etc.) and lines.
    
* Your sprite should be controlled using the keyboard. *You can choose the keys that move the sprite up, down, right, and left.
    
* The sprite should not be able to move off of the screen. If it "falls" off the screen in one direction, it should appear on the other side of the screen. i.e.: if it falls off the left side of the screen, it should reappear on the right side.

* The targets should always be moving.
    
* There should always be at least one target on the screen that the sprite can catch.

* Create at least three different classes, a main "game" class along with one for the sprite and one for the targets.
    
* Your program should use the structure and code we have gone over in class to set up the screen and event listeners for your game.
    
* Create an appropriate background/setting for your game to take place in.
    
* The game score should be drawn on the screen.
    
* When the sprite touches one of the targets, the targets and sprite should react (by changing size or color, for example). It is OK to calculate "touching" by using the "bounding sphere" or "bounding box" of your sprite and targets. You do not have to be exact here.
    
* When the sprite touches one of the targets, the on-screen score should increase.
   
* Your game should be personal and fun. You are encouraged to use many of the concepts we have covered in class in creative ways. You are also encoraged to create a game that is more complex than the one described here.

* Include the appropriate source code header.
   
* Include comments above each method that inlcude @param statements for every parameter.
    
* Carefully read and follow the course [Style Guidelines](https://handandmachine.cs.unm.edu/classes/CS152_Fall2020/styleGuidelines.html)
